Create a calculator application that
* Receives two numbers from command line

** You can change the order of inputs to what is easier for you. For example, you can ask for first number, the second number and then the operation or you can as for first number, the operation or the second number. 

** You have to validate each input to be a number (with decimals) or a valid operation (plus, multiply, minus or divide)
